# Teacher-attrition-with-MIRROR-data
Part of PhD research into teacher attrition, using administrative data in the Netherlands

The Dutch Ministry of Education uses research into the education labor market for their policy initiatives. Researchers developed a model to provide insight into teacher supply and demand (and other personnel in education). This model is developed by CentERdata and called MIRROR (Microsimulation Calculation Model Regional Education Estimates). For more information on MIRROR, check the [site](http://www.centerdata.nl/en/projects-by-centerdata/education-labor-market-estimates) of CentERdata

An agency of the Dutch Ministry of Education, Dienst Uitvoering Onderwijs (DUO), collects detailed information on the staff of publicly financed school for primary education, secondary education and post-secondary non-tertiary education. Based on these data, DUO yearly creates a file for MIRROR. This file will be utilized in this PdD research project to study teacher attrition.
